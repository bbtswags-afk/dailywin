🧠 Asking AI for Analysis...

================ DETAILED ANALYSIS =================

The Scout emphasized Arsenal's strong H2H dominance, particularly their 4-1 win in the last meeting, and their ability to score goals at home. The Accountant countered with concerns about Tottenham's resilience in away games and the potential for a 'trap game'. However, considering Arsenal's goal-scoring record and Tottenham's concession of goals in away games, the consensus leaned towards a match with multiple goals, making Over 1.5 Goals the safest and most plausible choice.

====================================================
Prediction: Over 1.5 Goals
Confidence: 80%
